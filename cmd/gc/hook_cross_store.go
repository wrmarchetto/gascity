// bestStoreWithWork runs command against each store and returns the output and

// candidate across every federated store, not merely the first store that has
// anything (applying the same normalize + unready-filter that doHook uses, so a
// store with only deferred/blocked rows is not a hit). run is injectable for
// tests.
//
// Why ranking rather than first-hit: the store list puts a city-scoped agent's
// OWN store ahead of the federated rig stores, so returning the first hit meant
// a rig-routed P0 stayed invisible behind a city P2 for as long as the city
// store had anything at all. Priority was never compared across the store
// boundary, so priority could not rescue it — for a crew agent that always has
// some city work, rig-routed beads were not deprioritized but unreachable.
// Ranking compares candidates the way the three-tier work_query intends them to
// be consumed (see hookCandidateRank), which makes the ordering hold ACROSS
// stores as well as within one. This changes only WHICH already-matching store
// is selected: every store's query still matches this agent's own identity, so
// no bead becomes visible that was not already routed or assigned to it.
//
// Ties keep the slice order, so an equally-ranked candidate in the agent's own
// store still wins — the pre-existing behavior whenever ranking is a wash.
//
// Two deliberate carve-outs from ranking:
//   - A tier-0 (in_progress) candidate in the PRIMARY store short-circuits.
//     Resuming this session's own interrupted work is unconditional, nothing may
//     preempt it, and short-circuiting keeps the hot resume path at one query.
//   - If any hit's output cannot be ranked (non-JSON, or JSON that is not an
//     array of objects), selection degrades to first-hit for the whole call.
//     Reordering on a comparison we could not actually make would be worse than
//     the behavior it replaces.
//
// When no store has ready work, an error on the agent's OWN store (identified by
// primary, not by slice position) is surfaced so emitCityWorkQueryFailure can
// classify it — preserving the single-store emit-on-timeout contract (a
// work-query timeout must reach the reconciler, not be silently downgraded to
// "no work"). Errors from federated rig stores are best-effort discovery (like
// appendRigHookStores) and are not surfaced, so one flaky rig store can't wedge
// the hook. primary is matched by identity rather than position because the
// federated claim loop reselects over a shrinking store set: once the primary
// store has been dropped it is no longer in stores, so no later federated store
// may inherit its emit-on-timeout semantics.
