// This file cuts the gc->bd read-storm documented on ga-ak6rt1: the
// control-dispatcher's per-tick readiness scan (workflowServeControlReadyQueryForBeads,
// dispatch_runtime.go) builds a shell script that fork-execs up to ~9
// bd/jq processes per agent per tick. Wire that same readiness evaluation to
// answer from an in-process CachingStore snapshot first, falling back to
// exactly one batched `bd ready --json` call when the snapshot can't answer,
// instead of the shell script's N separate `bd` invocations.
//
// Why this hooks into nextWorkflowServeBeads (the default workflowServeList
// implementation) rather than drainWorkflowServeWork: workflowServeList is a
// package var every existing serve-loop test overrides wholesale to fake the
// ready queue, so changing drainWorkflowServeWork's call site to bypass it
// for control-dispatcher agents would silently stop exercising ~25 existing
// tests' fakes. nextWorkflowServeBeads is never called directly by any
// existing test (they all replace workflowServeList outright), so extending
// its body here is additive: the exact query-string shape from
// workflowServeControlReadyQueryForBeads is unchanged (still asserted upon by
// TestWorkflowServeControlReadyQuery* tests), and any non-control-ready query
// -- or any failure standing up the cache -- falls straight through to the
// original shell exec, unchanged.

// controlReadyQueryMarkerPrefix identifies a workQuery produced by
// workflowServeControlReadyQueryForBeads. That function always writes this
// exact literal prefix (BD_EXPORT_AUTO=false plus a non-empty
// GC_CONTROL_TARGET, dispatch_runtime.go queryPrefix); no other work_query shape
// produces it.
const controlReadyQueryMarkerPrefix = "BD_EXPORT_AUTO=false GC_CONTROL_TARGET="

// controlReadyExcludeType mirrors the shell script's --exclude-type=epic.
const controlReadyExcludeType = "epic"

// controlReadyFallbackLimit bounds the single batched bd ready call issued
// when the cache can't answer. It must be generous enough that per-candidate/
// per-route filtering in Go (each capped at workflowServeScanLimit) is never
// starved by an earlier truncation at the bd layer -- unlike the shell script
// this replaces (which ran each candidate/route's own independently-capped bd
// call), this single batched call's cap is shared across every candidate and
// route, so it must hold a whole city's ready set even during the write
// bursts that make the cache dirty in the first place. It costs one bd call
// regardless of value, so err on the generous side; controlReadyFallbackReady
// also logs if a response ever comes back exactly at this limit, so silent
// truncation is at least observable.
const controlReadyFallbackLimit = 5000

// controlReadyCacheTTL bounds how long a primed control-ready snapshot is
// reused before the next tick re-primes it. A fresh CachingStore is built
// per drain invocation's first tick and reused for every ready bead
// processed in that invocation without any further bd calls; the TTL just

// The mail exclusion is the Go half of ci-bhvf, and it is the half that

// and beadsToHookBeads drops Type on the way out -- nothing downstream can
// tell them apart. drainWorkflowServeWork hands it to ProcessControl, whose
// switch has no case for it and answers `unsupported control bead kind ""`.
//
// What follows is the part worth knowing, because it is not the loud failure
// it looks like: runControlDispatcherWithStoreAndConfig classifies that as a
// hard control failure and QUARANTINES the bead -- closed, labeled
// gc:control-quarantined, stamped gc.outcome=fail and gc.failure_class=hard --
// then prints one stderr line and returns nil, which the drain loop counts as
// a processed cycle. So a message reaching here is destroyed unread and
// recorded as a controller failure, with the dispatcher reporting success.
// That is strictly worse than the worker path's version of this asymmetry,

//
// Measured bound, bd 1.1.1 on 2026-08-10: mail cannot reach here today. The

// beads then in the city store. So this is latent, for the same reason
// bdReadyPoolAliasDemandShell's copy is: the guard has to already be here if
