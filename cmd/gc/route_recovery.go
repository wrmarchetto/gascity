// carries (its legacy gc.run_target route, via carriedPoolRoute) for open,
// unassigned work whose canonical pool route was lost or never written. It
// returns the number of beads whose route it restored.
//
// The pool autoscaler keys exclusively on gc.routed_to, so an open work bead
// that carries a gc.run_target hint but an empty gc.routed_to is invisible to
// pool demand and never spawns a worker — the post-restart stall in ga-n2d.4
// (ready beads, 0 routed, 0 workers, until a manual `gc sling`). The controller
// runs this on startup and on every patrol tick so such work re-enters demand
// on its own. It is the automatic, broader-scoped promotion of the manual
// `gc doctor --fix` run-target-routed-to-backfill check.
//
// The recovery is judgment-free and cannot mis-route (ZFC): carriedPoolRoute
// only copies a route the bead already declares and skips control-dispatcher and
// topology beads. A bead with no carried route is left for its owner to sling —
// which pool ad-hoc work belongs to is the owner's judgment, not the
// controller's. Idempotent: an already-routed bead yields no route and is
// skipped.
//
// TOCTOU-narrowing (not eliminating): the open-bead List is a snapshot, so
// before writing, each bead is re-read through the store's authoritative,
// cache-bypassing live handle and skipped unless it is still open, unassigned,
// and carries the same recoverable route. This shrinks — but does not close —
// the window in which the re-stamp could clobber a route a polecat consumed by
// claiming the bead after the snapshot (ga-bgu): a claim landing between the
// live re-read and SetMetadata is still possible. The re-stamp stays monotonic
// (never worse than the prior blind write), so the residual window degrades to
// the pre-guard behavior rather than a new failure.
//
// That re-read guards claims but cannot guard blocks: a claim flips the bead to
// in_progress, which mapBdStatus preserves, while a block flips it to a status
// that collapses to "open" (gc-4zb). Blocked work is therefore excluded at the
// snapshot, by the Live query below, and not here.

	// Live is what makes Status:"open" mean open (gc-4zb). mapBdStatus folds
