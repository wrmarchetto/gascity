# check-census-owner-liveness.sh
#
# Order wrapper for the "census-owner-liveness" gc doctor check (ga-kr3glv.1,
# decision doc ga-kr3glv secs 2, 13). The resource-census ledger
# (test/test-resources.toml) anchors every row on an owner_bead, but nothing
# else in the pipeline notices when that bead stops resolving -- it happened
# once already (ga-c1slhq, same-day, <24h).
#
# Runs `gc doctor --json`, looks for dangling owner_bead findings from the
# census-owner-liveness check, and files one alert bead per distinct
# dangling owner_bead -- deduped against existing open alerts so a
# persistent condition doesn't spam a fresh bead on every cron tick.
#
# An owner_bead minted under another tracker's id prefix is reported by the
# check as "foreign owner_bead=", not "dangling owner_bead=", so it never
# reaches the alert path below. That wording is the contract between the two
# and is pinned from the Go side by
# TestCensusOwnerLivenessCheckReportsForeignOwnerBeadWithoutWarning.
#
# Detection only: this script never repairs the ledger or the bead store.
# Intended trigger: a cron order running every few hours (see the close-out
# notes on ga-kr3glv.1 for the order.toml to deploy).
#
# Security note: bead IDs and row text read from the ledger/doctor output
# are untrusted data, not trusted shell fragments. Every bd/jq invocation
# below passes that data as a quoted argv element or through `jq -n --arg`
# / a heredoc -- never through `sh -c`/`eval` string interpolation.
