package session

// Lifecycle-timer deciders for the session reconciler's max-session-age and
// idle-timeout policies. These are pure decision ladders over caller-gathered
// facts: the reconciler owns the trackers, provider probes, store queries,
// and side effects; this package owns precedence and the decision vocabulary.
//
// Expensive facts are gathered on demand. A decider that needs a fact the
// caller has not supplied returns a gather action naming it; the caller
// fills the fact in and decides again. That keeps fact-gathering order, cost,
// and fail-open/fail-closed error mapping with the caller while the ladder
// itself stays in one testable place.

// the caller has probed the runtime provider for an in-flight user turn.
