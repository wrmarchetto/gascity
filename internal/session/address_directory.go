// AddressDirectory is the narrow address and liveness read seam consumers use
// when their persistence is not the Sessions class. It intentionally exposes
// no Beads handle.
//
// The two resolve methods answer two different questions and deliberately do
// not share an algorithm:
//
//   - ResolveAddress answers "which session is this identifier", the question
//     session targeting has always asked. It reaches ResolveSessionID and
//     ResolveSessionIDAllowClosed — the same functions every raw-store caller
//     uses — so a caller that moves onto this seam resolves identically.
//   - ResolveMailboxAddress answers "which session owns this mailbox", which
//     admits no guessing: an address claimed by two sessions is ambiguous
//     rather than won by whichever key was probed first, because delivering a
//     message to the wrong session is worse than not delivering it.

// bead-id match first — a closed session included, so an identity stamped from
