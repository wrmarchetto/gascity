// registered Dolt destination is judged on its Dolt sync state (including the
// registered-but-never-synced case, which is unsafe), and only a scope that
// never migrated is judged on the legacy embedded-store state.
//
// The gate is fail-closed on doubt: an unreadable, unparseable, or
// timestamp-less state file blocks the deletion rather than being ignored,
// because it leaves the recovery point unknown. The one deliberate exception is
// a scope with NO backup state at all, which is treated as safe — "no backup
// configured" is DoltBackupCheck's concern, and failing closed there would

// scanBackupFreshness reports whether a scope's ACTIVE backup pipeline has
// stopped syncing.
//
// A scope has two possible pipelines and they record their progress in
// different files, and the two are ORTHOGONAL: registering a Dolt backup
// destination (.beads/dolt-backup.json) does not disable the legacy
// embedded-store pipeline, and `bd backup sync` writes only
// .beads/dolt-backup-state.json (updateDoltBackupState) — never
// .beads/backup/backup_state.json.
//
// So the two files are advanced by two different writers. On a scope where the
// legacy auto-backup is disabled, its writer never runs, and
// backup_state.json holds whatever it last recorded — while every BACKUP
// action the operator can take drives the OTHER pipeline's state file.
//
// The state this check did not model is "had a legacy bd backup, THEN gained a
// Dolt destination". It handles never-had-one (skip) and had-one-that-stopped
// (warn), but a scope whose legacy file is stale *because the live pipeline
// moved elsewhere* is reported as a broken backup pipeline while its actual
// backup is current. The FixHint compounds it by prescribing `bd backup sync`,
// which drives the Dolt pipeline and so cannot refresh the field being read.
//
// Note the warning condition itself implies the legacy pipeline is not
// running: were it still writing, backup_state.json would be fresh and this
// check would not fire at all.
//
// Note the check is not unclearable in the absolute — removing the legacy
// .beads/backup directory makes scanBackupFreshness skip the scope entirely.
// But no BACKUP action clears it: syncing the pipeline that is actually
// protecting the scope never moves the field this check reads.
//
// Reading the Dolt registration here is consistent with the rest of the
// package rather than novel: checks_bd_backup_state.go already treats
// .beads/dolt-backup.json as first-class when detecting stale registrations.
// This check alone ignored it.
//
// There is also a correctness stake beyond noise: the stale legacy state
// advertises a Dolt commit written before the destination was registered, so an
// incident responder restoring from that pointer recovers a pre-migration
// snapshot while believing the scope is current.
//
// So: prefer the Dolt backup state whenever a Dolt destination is registered,
// and fall back to the legacy file only for scopes that never migrated. Each
// finding names the store it describes, so the reader is never left guessing
// which of the two a message is about. A scope with neither file returns
// ("", false) — "no backup at all" is DoltBackupCheck's job, not this one's.
