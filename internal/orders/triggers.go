// 1/(interval - interval/divisor) -- at 6, a 20% ceiling on the overshoot.
//
// SIZED AGAINST THE TAIL OF THE DISPATCH LATENCY, NOT ITS MEAN. The first
// draft used 10, giving a 3s allowance on a 30s interval against a latency
// whose mean is ~1.06s. That was wrong: 1.06s was an aggregate measured as
// each dispatch's offset from its own tick's FIRST write, which pins the
// first dispatch of every tick at zero by construction and so understates
// the real tick-start-to-write gap. Measured properly off the controller
// trace (site_code orders.dispatch, n=214 ticks, 2026-09-08), the gap runs
// p50 0.83s / p90 2.38s for the first order dispatched in a tick and p50
// 2.89s / p90 3.62s for the eighth, with the whole dispatch phase at p50
// 3.0s and p90 3.5s. A 3s allowance therefore relapses whenever a 30s order
// lands late in a tick's candidate order, which is the failure this constant
// exists to prevent. 6 gives 5s there, clearing the p90 with margin.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT COVER, so nobody reads this as a total fix: the
// dispatch phase reached 10.5s at its max, and dolt-health and beads-health
// do their gate reads and their tracking-bead write against the very store
// whose health they report, behind two serial gates at orderGateTimeout=8s
// each. Their latency is therefore correlated with the degradation they
// exist to detect, and under it they will still slip a tick. No allowance
// under one tick can cover a 16s gate stall; closing that needs the cooldown
// clock to stop being a timestamp written after the work
// (cmd/gc/order_dispatch.go:781), which is a change to the bead write path
// and is deliberately NOT attempted here.
